# KUBIKA system - API Documentation

## Base URL
```
http://localhost:5000/api
```

## Authentication

All endpoints (except login and register) require a JWT token in the Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

## Common Response Codes

- `200` - Success
- `201` - Created
- `400` - Bad Request
- `401` - Unauthorized
- `403` - Forbidden
- `404` - Not Found
- `500` - Server Error

## Application Error Codes

These are application-level error codes returned in the JSON body alongside an HTTP status. They help callers distinguish business-rule failures from generic HTTP errors.

- `MOVEMENT_IMMUTABLE` — HTTP `405 Method Not Allowed`.
  - Returned when an attempt is made to modify or delete a `StockMovement`. Stock movements are immutable; create compensating movements instead.

- `INSUFFICIENT_STOCK` — HTTP `409 Conflict`.
  - Returned when an operation would dispatch or consume more stock than the available on-hand quantity (on-hand minus reserved). Example: confirming a delivery where available stock < requested quantity.

- `WAREHOUSE_HAS_STOCK` — HTTP `409 Conflict`.
  - Returned when attempting to deactivate a `Warehouse` that still contains available stock (one or more `InventoryBatch` with `availableQuantity > 0`).

- `CATEGORY_IN_USE` — HTTP `409 Conflict`.
  - Returned when attempting to delete a `Category` that still has products assigned.

Example error response body:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Insufficient available stock to confirm delivery",
  "code": "INSUFFICIENT_STOCK"
}
```

Where applicable the API will also return a human-readable `message` and an appropriate HTTP status code.
